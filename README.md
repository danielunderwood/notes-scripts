# notes-scripts
Scripts for organizing and reformatting notes, including a number of utilities
for migrating from Roam to Obsidian.

**Use at your own risk. You should have a backup of your notes anyway, but it's
a good idea to back them up before running scripts on them.**

| rename_date_references.py | Finds roam references (e.g., January 1st, 2020) and replaces them with our daily note format                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| roam_mathjax_fix.py       | Roam uses double dollar signs everywhere for math. Obsidian uses single for inline and double for multi-line. This converts any lines with double dollar signs to single dollar signs unless they're the only thing on the line (you were writing multi-line math in Roam)  !!! Back up your notes before running this. It should be pretty safe, but who knows !!! |
| sort_dailies.py           | Sorts daily notes into months, such as 2020-01-01 -> Notes/2020/01 - January/01.md                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
